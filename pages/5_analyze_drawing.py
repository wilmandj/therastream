Analyze Drawing Page

This script facilitates the upload and analysis of drawings by interpreting 
them as expressions of the subject's subconscious mind. It combines image 
captions with system prompts for psychological analysis and displays AI 
responses.

**Image Analysis:**
   - The image analysis now saves images to a local directory and uses image URLs for processing.
